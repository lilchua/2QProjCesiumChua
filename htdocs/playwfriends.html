                <p class="boxleft">
                    During the first few weeks of the school year, we were all shy to didn't know how to talk to each 
                    other. We didn’t really know one other yet and all we could talk about were requirements. Finally, 
                    EJ, Mauje, Iel, Toffe, and I decided to form a study group together. A bit later, we also added Iyaj 
                    and Cairo.
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    But of course, we got a little sidetracked. Instead of focusing on requirements, we would talk about 
                    games like Mobile Legends or Call of Duty. Then out of nowehere, I asked them “Gusto niyo laro tayo 
                    ng MC?” They agreed and so we decided to play together in one server, all starting from scratch.
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    At first, we did say we would work and beat the game together but we would always tease and kill 
                    each other, A LOT. We would keep losing all the hard work and resources we made. We kept deleting 
                    old worlds and creating new ones because we kept wasting resources. We would always lose them!
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    Then we got the idea to do something else. EJ, Moji, Iel, Toffe, and I decided to create a free for 
                    all world, where we each had about 25 minutes to gather resources and fight each other to the death. 
                    Last man standing wins. Surprisingly, we got more done when we were doing this than what we got in our original world!
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    Then it was time to battle. At first, no one wanted to go near each other. Then suddenly, we all 
                    chased each other and battled each other to the death. It was so fun! Altough I was so nervous, I 
                    continued to run. In the end, I managed to kill everyone, LOL! I was the winner! They congratulated 
                    me, but it felt like they were being sarcastic. I told them to take a picture because it was going
                    to be one of our greatest memories.
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    After the picture, we then continued to tease each other! Toffe placed lava down near where we were 
                    all standing and we all died! After that, since they were so annoyed at me for winning, they all 
                    teamed up and chased me down!
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    A few days later, we then played Skipping Stones, which was a game I created. The game is to  
                    do parkour while other people were shooting at you. To be honest, it was so irritating because not 
                    only was the parkour hard to do, but it was also even harder because my friends were shooting at us 
                    non-stop! After that, we played bed-wars in a server named, Battle Asya. 
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    I gotta say, I enjoyed the company of my friends. I am very glad that the class compositions were 
                    shuffled and I got to meet new people. Honestly, I am very grateful to meet them. We sometimes get 
                    mad at each other but we know that deep down, we appreciate each other. Time flies so fast, we have 
                    now gone through the 1st Quarter of Grade 9. Who knows what’s in store for us next? What monsters we 
                    will fight in the future? What new things will we build? What game will we play next?
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    Playing Minecraft made me realize that life is more fun if 
                    you get to do anything you want. However, it is more fun if you get to spend it with other people.
