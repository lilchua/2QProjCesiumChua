                <p class="boxleft" style="width: 85.2%;">
                    Here are my survival tips that you will find very useful if you have just started Minecraft. I hope you 
                    learn something!
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span> 1.) Punch a tree!</span>
                    <br>
                    Wood might be the most useful block when you are still starting your world. Chop down a few trees and grab at 
                    least 16 pieces (to be sure!) or more as you will need wood for almost everything: to create tools and for building.
                    Find the nearest tree and chop it down! Make sure the tree doesn't have beehive though. They will attack you. Don't 
                    destroy their home!
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span>2.) Find food.</span>
                    <br>
                    Before going on to an adventure, make sure you find some food. You can gather food by killing animals or by looting a 
                    village. Without food, you will soon lose your hunger bar. You will eventually lose your ability to sprint at 3 hunger bars. 
                    You will also will not be able to heal if your health bar is lower than 9. No one likes to battle mobs with an empty stomach, right?
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span>3.) Find sheep! baa... baaa! (Sheep-transilator: optional!)</span>
                    <br>
                    Some people might not agree, but I always follow this step every time I start a world: I look for sheep. Sheep drops wool when killed, 
                    and wool can be used to create a bed. I always want to have a bed with me, just because I want to skip nighttime where all different mobs 
                    start to spawn when I go exploring and to set my spawn when I go mining in a cave. Without any materials, I wouldn’t survive a night.
                    Sheep also drops mutton, which when cooked gives you 4 hunger bar. It’s kind of a win-win, right?
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span>4.) Look for a cave or a raven and mine.</span>
                    <br>
                    Mine. Mine. Mine and mine, like there is no tomorrow. You will need to collect as many resources as you can! Mine iron and coal because these 
                    are very useful as your starting materials. Watch out for diamonds, because this is the most valuable ore in the Overworld. Make sure to watch 
                    your step, you might fall into mobs or worse: lava!
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span>5.) Build your base.</span>
                    <br>
                    With a good amount of resources, you should now build a proper base. Use any material you’d like! However, preferably not out of wood, because this can 
                    easily burn off with fire. Another quick tip I would like to share is that when building a base, make sure to build it near a village. With this, you can 
                    start trading with villagers, since this is very handy. When you want to put enchantments on armor and tools, you can trade with librarians. You can trade 
                    with armorers for iron and diamond armor. To buy these though, you will need emeralds. You can find emeralds in caves. Though, the easiest way to get emeralds 
                    is through a fletcher, who can trade you 32 sticks for 1 emerald. 
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft" style="width: 85.2%;">
                    After following all these steps, congrats! You already know the basics. Now, go explore as much as you want. Though, here are some more tips for you:
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">End the Enderman</span>
                    <br>
                    There are actually three ways to stop enderman. <br>
                    1.) Don't look at their eyes. They will feel threatened and attack you. <br>
                    2.) Block yourself into a 2 block ceiling. They can’t reach you and hurt you this way. This was actually used as a way to farm for enderpearls.<br>
                    3.) The third is water! Enderman take damage with water, so if you come across an Enderman or go to the End, just jump in to some water, and you’ll be safe from harm. <br>
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With Wither Skeletons comes Better Plays</span>
                    <br>
                    Wither Skeletons spawn in the Nether Fortress. They are tall skeletons that hit hard. They also inflict wither which inflicts damage on your life points overtime. You don’t want 
                    to fight them without any materials. To be safe, you must have at least full iron armor and iron tools. Though, there is a way to counter their attacks. Plus, it’s so simple. Wither 
                    Skeletons can’t go through 2 block high spaces. The nether fortress is a huge fortress with long corridors. When there are wither skeletons chasing you, just block off the ceiling and 
                    they can’t reach you. This is also a very good way to farm for wither skeleton skulls if you want to spawn the Wither.
                    <br><br>
                    Why is being tall so hard?
                </p>
                
                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Evil Pillagers</span>
                    <br>
                    Pillagers live in woodland mansions and they can easily kill you. They have iron axes as weapons and they can kill you very easily if you don’t have any armor or tools. I was killed multiple 
                    times the first time I went to a woodland mansion. The best way to evade their attacks is to nerd pole! Nerd-pole up to three blocks and they can’t reach you and kill you. That’s how you secure 
                    the kill.
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breathe Underwater</span>
                    <br>
                    You can only breath underwater for a certain amount of time. After losing 10 water bubbles, you will lose hearts. So, what should you do? You can use a water breathing potion or wear a turtle cap,
                    but what if you don't? Well, find a <b>magma block.</b> 
                    <br><br>
                    Being on top of a magma block will give you air bubbles. Though, you will lose lives when you stand on it.  Crouching on it, though, will make it
                    not hurt you anymore.
                </p>
