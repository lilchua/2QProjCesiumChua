                <p class="boxleft">
                    When I was still in elementary, Minecraft was so popular. It was the only sandbox game ahead of its 
                    time. You can build anything you want, fight dangerous and difficult monsters, and explore different kinds of environments.
                    However unlike everyone else, I couldn’t play Minecraft because 1) it was a paid app, 2) I didn’t 
                    have my own phone, and 3) I wasn’t allowed to play or watch TV during schooldays, only on weekdays. 
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    However, every Friday my brother and I would watch YouTube videos on the desktop computer. We would 
                    watch a lot of different Minecraft videos, and imagine that we were there playing with the different 
                    Youtubers. The two YouTubers that influenced both of us are Stampylongnose and iBallistiicsquid. Through 
                    their content, it created a bond between us that we would keep forever. They create videos almost every 
                    day during 2014, and we get to binge-watch all the episodes when Friday came. So, UNTIL NOW, I’m still 
                    watching some of their Minecraft series during my free time and still enjoy watching it. I have watched 
                    several series such as: Crazy Craft, Race to the Moon, Mission to Mars, Islands of Eden, Dropper maps, 
                    Hunger Games, and so many different Adventure maps, each with their own funny moments and memories. 
                    Now, I’m watching their Islands of Eden 2, which was released last 2016. I still have a lot to catch 
                    up from the last 5 years, and there are so much more minecraft series I have yet to watch!
                </p>

                <p class="boxleft">
                    Stampy’s and Squid’s friendship with each other is an inspiration for me. They tease each other (and 
                    sometimes kill each other, in minecraft of course), but they all do it for fun. Sometimes they sing 
                    and dance, andthey tell jokes and fool around. They sometimes even speak in high pitched voices! It 
                    really makes me feel like I have a special connection with them. I think other viewers like me felt 
                    the same way. They have raised a generation through their content and inspired a lot of other people. 
                    Although they currently don’t release as many videos as before, I still find the joy to watch their 
                    content even while I'm already 15! They have made my childhood a lot more awesomer! They filled my 
                    childhood with joy.
